  <h1>obj</h1>
  <p>types of ai</p>
  <p>artificial narrow intelligence</p>
  <p>artificial General intelligence</p>
  <p>Everything is develped using ANI not the AGI. Nothing is developed yet in agi</p>
  <p>narrow</p>
  <p>model agent robot are creted to perform tasks</p>
  <p>agi can perform Everything or any type of task listening speaking think</p>
  <h2>ANI EXAMPLE</h2>
  <p>ex smart speakers (Iron man)</p>
  <p>Self driving car , every model as its own tasks</p>
  <hr>
  <p>AGI : goal of AI is to develop an AGI . they can perform like human or better than human</p>
  <p>single model contain every functionality</p>

  <h1>Machine Learning</h1>
  <p>application of AI  </p>
  <p>that system  to automatically learn  and improve without being programmed</p>
  <p>Machine learning focuses on development of computer programs that can access data and use to learn for themselves</p>
  <p>supervised learning : we provide data and label and machine leanrs itself </p>
  <p>un supervised leanring : we provide data not the supervision , not the labels</p>
  <p>sup learning : exp</p>
  <p>giving input and getting the output : speech recognition</p>
  <p>converting a language into another lang is also example : application machine translation</p>
  <p>online adds: recommended apps</p>
  <p>search log is taken and used by algo then adds are recommended</p>
  <p>self driving car : getting input from redar ,gps, etc and other cars positions are identified and then processed</p>
  <p>manufacturing companies  is also another exp: identify the good product quality, defect </p>
