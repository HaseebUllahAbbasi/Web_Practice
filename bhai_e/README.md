# READ THIS FIRST - READ THIS CAREFULLY

## Coursework Challenge
Welcome to this coursework challenge

This is an individual coursework, so whilst you are allowed to discuss both the challenges _and_ the approaches you might take to tackling them, all work must be your own.

Unit tests are in the same format that you have completed previously and can be found in `tests.js`

To run the unit tests you should open `index.html` in a browser.  Initially the tests will fail.  You should open and edit the `index.js` file, modifying and adding functions as necessary to make each test pass.

## Submission / Upload
* When you have completed all the tests to the best of your ability, upload your `index.js` file to the dropbox on moodle.
* **`index.js` is the only file that you can upload.**

## Tips

* Use Pseudo-code to work out the steps you have to do.
  * Writing the steps in human readable words can help if you're searching the web for approaches that might help with the solution.

* Sometimes you *will* need to look at what’s being asserted in `tests.js` in order to understand what is being tested.

* If you can’t make the _whole_ test green - try to get as many assertions as possible to pass.

* You should find some of these are *hard* - so it’s ok to find them hard - we are pushing you.

* If you get stuck, move on.
  * Later, return to those you can’t do.
  * Your brain will worked on the problem in the background for you.

* A passing test does not mean you're finished.
  * It may be that there are shorter and more maintainable solutions to what you initially create.
  * Get basic solutions working, then return to them and improve them.

* You are not restricted to creating only one function for each solution. e.g. If JS doesn't provide a native API for something you want - make a function that does it, and call that function.
