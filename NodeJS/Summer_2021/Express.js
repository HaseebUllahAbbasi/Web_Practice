/*
Node web framework ::
t provides mechanisms to:

    Write handlers for requests with different HTTP verbs at different URL paths (routes).

    Integrate with "view" rendering engines in order to generate responses by inserting data into templates.
    
    Set common web application settings like the port to use for connecting, and the location of templates that are used for rendering the response.
    
    Add additional request processing "middleware" at any point within the request handling pipeline.
